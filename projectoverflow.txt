1. Run script template.py to create project folder structure.
2. pip install -r requirements.txt

-- Setting up the infra --
1. Put SUPABASE_DB_URL (connection string), Pinecone API key and index name in .env
    # connection string of Supabase can be found using search box on the website and then select session pooler (an not transaction pooler).
2. Write script for connection establishment and connection pooling of posatgresServer(app/db/checkpointer.py) and vector store making (app/db/vector_store.py).
3. Write a test_infra.py in root directory to test the connection scripts.

-- Creating ETL (extract, Transform, Load) pipeline (the Ingestion pipeline) --
1. Write app/graph/ingestion.py script which has two functions 
    # 1st takes youtube video URL, fetches transcript, converts to document, adds metadata, splits into chunks then saves to Pinecone Vector Store.
    # 2nd loads a pdf, adds metadata, splits doc into chunks then saves to vector store.

-- Adding basic retrieval and advanced retrieval (RAG), the Logic pipeline -- 
1. Add app/graph/retrieval.py script which takes a query and finds relevant documents in vector_store.
2. Add app/graph/advanced_retrieval.py which uses Re-ranker to apply contexual search on top of vector_store's semantically searched documents to find more accurate relevant documents.

-- Supervisor main graph to manage subgraph search and internet tool search (Orchestration pipeline) --
1. Create a subgraph(app/graph/subgraphs/rag_graph.py) script to utilize advanced retrieval and then generate text based on retrieved documents.
2. Create a node script, app/graph/nodes/rag_agent_node.py to invoke above subgraph.
3. Create another node script, app/graph/nodes/web_search.py to perform a internet search for a query.
4. Create a supervisor node script, app/graph/nodes/supervisor.py to make a decision for a query regarding whether send that to internet search or database search using subgraph node.
5. Create the main/parent graph script, app/graph/workflow.py, to manage above created three nodes.

-- Productionization --
1. Write a FAST API server script app/api/server.py
    # Run this command in terminal "uvicorn app.api.server:app --reload" to start the server. "--reload" is there to automatically restart server whenver there is a change in the project code.
    # Access the "Swagger UI" here, "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs"
2. Write a chainlit UI script, app/ui/chat_app.py, which doesn't call FASTAPI(localhost:8000) but rather directly imports LangGraph obejct.
    # Run this command in mac terminal "chainlit run app/ui/chat_app.py -w" annd it will open a new chatgpt style tab in browser.

-- Looping (for multi agentic tasks) and Memory --
1. Update server.py to add asynchronus PostGres Memory/db inside event loop so that our app can remember older chats.
2. Update (mainly) workflow.py and supervisor.py to add looping mechanism so that app can handle multiple subqueries in one big query.
    # New edges will be added from web search tool to main supervisor and rag sub graph to main supervisor/graph.
